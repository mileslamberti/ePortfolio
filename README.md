# ePortfolio Project


# Dev-env
      
Still unstable so apologies if it doesnt work 

Clone the repo with command `git clone https://github.com/mileslamberti/ePortfolio.git your-local-repositary-name`

move into the project directory `cd your-local-repositary-name`

then run the following command which installs all package dependancies
`cd client && npm install && cd .. && cd api && npm install cd && npm install`

To launch both client and server-side concurrent run
`npm start`
